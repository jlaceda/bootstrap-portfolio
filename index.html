                    <p>I'm John Michael Laceda. I'm an aspiring Full
                        Stack Developer with an extensive tech
                        background in supporting backend services. I
                        hail from a land across the Great Puget Sound in
                        Bremerton Washington. I currently sail into
                        Seattle for work everyday! My beautiful fianc√©e
                        and I take care of a cute little Rat-Cha
                        (Chihuahua / Rat Terrier mix) named Bella and an
                        old spinster Tabby named Pudgy.</p>
                    <p>I grew up in the Philippines and survived a <a

                            eruption</a> before my family and I
                        emigrated to The United States of America.</p>
                    <p>In high school I took a Computer Aided Drafting
                        class as an elective. This set me on a course to
                        wanting to learn all about computers and started
                        breaking and fixing (if I was lucky!) our family
                        computer. I started to get into Linux and
                        eventually got a job supporting back end
                        services run on Linux servers.</p>
                    <p>My hobbies are fleeting obsessions. As a youth I
                        was very into music so I joined a couple of
                        garage bands that fizzled out. Around the same
                        time I got into competitive video games with
                        pipe dreams of being a <a target="blank"

                            War bonjwa</a> but I was never really good.
                        Recently, I've forced a friend group to play a
                        Dungeons and Dragons campaign and Magic: the
                        Gathering (which is objectively the best game),
                        both which are collecting dust somewhere.</p>
                    <p>My passion for the internet and computers never
                        waned and I'm doubling down! Adding Full Stack
                        Developer skills to my backend support
                        experience. The idea of directly creating
                        products and tools for anyone on the internet to
                        use is very exciting to me!</p>
